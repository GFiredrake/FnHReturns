Iv have been limited by my database availability on this project as I would have liked to have had the
connection between log in screen and database finished rather than moving onto the registration screen 
before finishing but unfortunately I did not have a database properly set up so I left the code for this 
commented out so you could see the intention.

Similarly with more time I would have liked to refine allot more of the logic out of the JavaScript files
knock-out but I just wanted to include a little illustration of dom manipulation an use of ajax in a limited
time.

I kept the view of desktop in mainly but mainly developed for mobile in mind keeping assets loaded per page
to a minimum and focusing on mobile aesthetics over desktop, whilst insuring an acceptable experience on 
desktop.

in all this took me about 9 hours of work  so just over a single standard working day to achieve. there is 
allot more I would have liked to have done given the time and availability of a database.
